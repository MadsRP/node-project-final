node-project-final

To Run The Program:

Open node-project-backend, and run -npm start through the terminal, which will start up the backend, and allow you to contact the databse (artists.json)

Then open up the node-project, and run the index.html with a live server, and through the UI on the website, you will be able to see a list of the artists that are currently within the database. 

You can add new artists through the PLUS log on the site, and you will be able to edit or delete the specific artists after clicking on them in the list.
